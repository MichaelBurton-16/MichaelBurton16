### Hello There :wave:
I'm a Financial Planning and Analysis analyst currently looking to further develop my analytical skills through data science.

I've taken courses on Udemy.com centered around using Python and SQL to solve real world business problems and improve my data visualization/dashboard reporting skills in an effort to give senior leadership or whomever may be using my analysis a better understanding of their business's health.

This portfolio serves as body work developed from my coding classes to help highlight and display applicable projects I've worked on that I found to be interesting and engaging.
